      CONCURRENTLY</code> (Andres Freund, Tom Lane, Simon Riggs, Pavan Deolasee)
     </p><p>      An error introduced while adding <code class="command">DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code>
      allowed incorrect indexing decisions to be made during the initial
      phase of <code class="command">CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code>; so that indexes built
      by that command could be corrupt.  It is recommended that indexes
      built in 9.2.X with <code class="command">CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code> be rebuilt
      after applying this update.
     </p><p>      In addition, fix <code class="command">CREATE/DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code> to use
      in-place updates when changing the state of an index's
      <code class="structname">pg_index</code> row.  This prevents race conditions that could
      cause concurrent sessions to miss updating the target index, thus
      again resulting in corrupt concurrently-created indexes.
     </p><p>      Also, fix various other operations to ensure that they ignore
      invalid indexes resulting from a failed <code class="command">CREATE INDEX
      CONCURRENTLY</code> command.  The most important of these is
      <code class="command">VACUUM</code>, because an auto-vacuum could easily be launched
      on the table before corrective action can be taken to fix or remove
      the invalid index.
     </p><p>      Also fix <code class="command">DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code> to not disable
      insertions into the target index until all queries using it are done.
     </p><p>      Also fix misbehavior if <code class="command">DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code> is
      canceled: the previous coding could leave an un-droppable index behind.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Correct predicate locking for <code class="command">DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code>
      (Kevin Grittner)
     </p><p>      Previously, SSI predicate locks were processed at the wrong time,
      possibly leading to incorrect behavior of serializable transactions
      executing in parallel with the <code class="command">DROP</code>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix buffer locking during WAL replay (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The WAL replay code was insufficiently careful about locking buffers
      when replaying WAL records that affect more than one page.  This could
      result in hot standby queries transiently seeing inconsistent states,
      resulting in wrong answers or unexpected failures.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix an error in WAL generation logic for GIN indexes (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This could result in index corruption, if a torn-page failure occurred.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix an error in WAL replay logic for SP-GiST indexes (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This could result in index corruption after a crash, or on a standby
      server.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect detection of end-of-base-backup location during WAL
      recovery (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      This mistake allowed hot standby mode to start up before the database
      reaches a consistent state.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Properly remove startup process's virtual XID lock when promoting a
      hot standby server to normal running (Simon Riggs)
     </p><p>      This oversight could prevent subsequent execution of certain
      operations such as <code class="command">CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid bogus <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">out-of-sequence timeline ID</span>”</span> errors in standby
      mode (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent the postmaster from launching new child processes after it's
      received a shutdown signal (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This mistake could result in shutdown taking longer than it should, or
      even never completing at all without additional user action.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix the syslogger process to not fail when
      <code class="varname">log_rotation_age</code> exceeds 2^31 milliseconds (about 25 days)
      (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="function">WaitLatch()</code> to return promptly when the requested
      timeout expires (Jeff Janes, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      With the previous coding, a steady stream of non-wait-terminating
      interrupts could delay return from <code class="function">WaitLatch()</code>
      indefinitely.  This has been shown to be a problem for the autovacuum
      launcher process, and might cause trouble elsewhere as well.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid corruption of internal hash tables when out of memory
      (Hitoshi Harada)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent file descriptors for dropped tables from being held open past
      transaction end (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This should reduce problems with long-since-dropped tables continuing
      to occupy disk space.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent database-wide crash and restart when a new child process is
      unable to create a pipe for its latch (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Although the new process must fail, there is no good reason to force a
      database-wide restart, so avoid that.  This improves robustness when
      the kernel is nearly out of file descriptors.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid planner crash with joins to unflattened subqueries (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix planning of non-strict equivalence clauses above outer joins
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The planner could derive incorrect constraints from a clause equating
      a non-strict construct to something else, for example
      <code class="literal">WHERE COALESCE(foo, 0) = 0</code>
      when <code class="literal">foo</code> is coming from the nullable side of an outer join.
      9.2 showed this type of error in more cases than previous releases,
      but the basic bug has been there for a long time.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="command">SELECT DISTINCT</code> with index-optimized
      <code class="function">MIN</code>/<code class="function">MAX</code> on an inheritance tree (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The planner would fail with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">failed to re-find MinMaxAggInfo
      record</span>”</span> given this combination of factors.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Make sure the planner sees implicit and explicit casts as equivalent
      for all purposes, except in the minority of cases where there's
      actually a semantic difference (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Include join clauses when considering whether partial indexes can be
      used for a query (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      A strict join clause can be sufficient to establish an
      <em class="replaceable"><code>x</code></em> <code class="literal">IS NOT NULL</code> predicate, for example.
      This fixes a planner regression in 9.2, since previous versions could
      make comparable deductions.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Limit growth of planning time when there are many indexable join
      clauses for the same index (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve planner's ability to prove exclusion constraints from
      equivalence classes (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix partial-row matching in hashed subplans to handle cross-type cases
      correctly (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This affects multicolumn <code class="literal">NOT IN</code> subplans, such as
      <code class="literal">WHERE (a, b) NOT IN (SELECT x, y FROM ...)</code>
      when for instance <code class="literal">b</code> and <code class="literal">y</code> are <code class="type">int4</code>
      and <code class="type">int8</code> respectively.  This mistake led to wrong answers
      or crashes depending on the specific datatypes involved.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix btree mark/restore functions to handle array keys (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This oversight could result in wrong answers from merge joins whose
      inner side is an index scan using an
      <code class="literal"><em class="replaceable"><code>indexed_column</code></em> =
      ANY(<em class="replaceable"><code>array</code></em>)</code> condition.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Revert patch for taking fewer snapshots (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The 9.2 change to reduce the number of snapshots taken during query
      execution led to some anomalous behaviors not seen in previous
      releases, because execution would proceed with a snapshot acquired
      before locking the tables used by the query.  Thus, for example,
      a query would not be guaranteed to see updates committed by a
      preceding transaction even if that transaction had exclusive lock.
      We'll probably revisit this in future releases, but meanwhile put it
      back the way it was before 9.2.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Acquire buffer lock when re-fetching the old tuple for an
      <code class="literal">AFTER ROW UPDATE/DELETE</code> trigger (Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      In very unusual circumstances, this oversight could result in passing
      incorrect data to a trigger <code class="literal">WHEN</code> condition, or to the
      precheck logic for a foreign-key enforcement trigger.  That could
      result in a crash, or in an incorrect decision about whether to
      fire the trigger.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="command">ALTER COLUMN TYPE</code> to handle inherited check
      constraints properly (Pavan Deolasee)
     </p><p>      This worked correctly in pre-8.4 releases, and now works correctly
      in 8.4 and later.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="command">ALTER EXTENSION SET SCHEMA</code>'s failure  to move some
      subsidiary objects into the new schema (Álvaro Herrera, Dimitri
      Fontaine)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Handle <code class="command">CREATE TABLE AS EXECUTE</code> correctly in extended query
      protocol (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Don't modify the input parse tree in <code class="command">DROP RULE IF NOT
      EXISTS</code> and <code class="command">DROP TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This mistake would cause errors if a cached statement of one of these
      types was re-executed.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="command">REASSIGN OWNED</code> to handle grants on tablespaces
      (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ignore incorrect <code class="structname">pg_attribute</code> entries for system
      columns for views (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Views do not have any system columns.  However, we forgot to
      remove such entries when converting a table to a view.  That's fixed
      properly for 9.3 and later, but in previous branches we need to defend
      against existing mis-converted views.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix rule printing to dump <code class="literal">INSERT INTO <em class="replaceable"><code>table</code></em>
      DEFAULT VALUES</code> correctly (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Guard against stack overflow when there are too many
      <code class="literal">UNION</code>/<code class="literal">INTERSECT</code>/<code class="literal">EXCEPT</code> clauses
      in a query (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent platform-dependent failures when dividing the minimum possible
      integer value by -1 (Xi Wang, Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix possible access past end of string in date parsing
      (Hitoshi Harada)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix failure to advance XID epoch if XID wraparound happens during a
      checkpoint and <code class="varname">wal_level</code> is <code class="literal">hot_standby</code>
      (Tom Lane, Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      While this mistake had no particular impact on
      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> itself, it was bad for
      applications that rely on <code class="function">txid_current()</code> and related
      functions: the TXID value would appear to go backwards.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="function">pg_terminate_backend()</code> and
      <code class="function">pg_cancel_backend()</code> to not throw error for a non-existent
      target process (Josh Kupershmidt)
     </p><p>      This case already worked as intended when called by a superuser,
      but not so much when called by ordinary users.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix display of
      <code class="structname">pg_stat_replication</code>.<code class="structfield">sync_state</code> at a
      page boundary (Kyotaro Horiguchi)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Produce an understandable error message if the length of the path name
      for a Unix-domain socket exceeds the platform-specific limit
      (Tom Lane, Andrew Dunstan)
     </p><p>      Formerly, this would result in something quite unhelpful, such as
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Non-recoverable failure in name resolution</span>”</span>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix memory leaks when sending composite column values to the client
      (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Save some cycles by not searching for subtransaction locks at commit
      (Simon Riggs)
     </p><p>      In a transaction holding many exclusive locks, this useless activity
      could be quite costly.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Make <span class="application">pg_ctl</span> more robust about reading the
      <code class="filename">postmaster.pid</code> file (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      This fixes race conditions and possible file descriptor leakage.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix possible crash in <span class="application">psql</span> if incorrectly-encoded data
      is presented and the <code class="varname">client_encoding</code> setting is a
      client-only encoding, such as SJIS (Jiang Guiqing)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Make <span class="application">pg_dump</span> dump <code class="literal">SEQUENCE SET</code> items in
      the data not pre-data section of the archive (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This fixes an undesirable inconsistency between the meanings of
      <code class="option">--data-only</code> and <code class="option">--section=data</code>, and also fixes
      dumping of sequences that are marked as extension configuration tables.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">pg_dump</span>'s handling of <code class="command">DROP DATABASE</code>
      commands in <code class="option">--clean</code> mode (Guillaume Lelarge)
     </p><p>      Beginning in 9.2.0, <code class="literal">pg_dump --clean</code> would issue a
      <code class="command">DROP DATABASE</code> command, which was either useless or
      dangerous depending on the usage scenario.  It no longer does that.
      This change also fixes the combination of <code class="option">--clean</code> and
      <code class="option">--create</code> to work sensibly, i.e., emit <code class="command">DROP
      DATABASE</code> then <code class="command">CREATE DATABASE</code> before reconnecting to the
      target database.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">pg_dump</span> for views with circular dependencies and
      no relation options (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The previous fix to dump relation options when a view is
      involved in a circular dependency didn't work right for the case
      that the view has no options; it emitted <code class="literal">ALTER VIEW foo
      SET ()</code> which is invalid syntax.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix bugs in the <code class="filename">restore.sql</code> script emitted by
      <span class="application">pg_dump</span> in <code class="literal">tar</code> output format (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The script would fail outright on tables whose names include
      upper-case characters.  Also, make the script capable of restoring
      data in <code class="option">--inserts</code> mode as well as the regular COPY mode.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">pg_restore</span> to accept POSIX-conformant
      <code class="literal">tar</code> files (Brian Weaver, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The original coding of <span class="application">pg_dump</span>'s <code class="literal">tar</code>
      output mode produced files that are not fully conformant with the
      POSIX standard.  This has been corrected for version 9.3.  This
      patch updates previous branches so that they will accept both the
      incorrect and the corrected formats, in hopes of avoiding
      compatibility problems when 9.3 comes out.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="literal">tar</code> files emitted by <span class="application">pg_basebackup</span> to
      be POSIX conformant (Brian Weaver, Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">pg_resetxlog</span> to locate <code class="filename">postmaster.pid</code>
      correctly when given a relative path to the data directory (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This mistake could lead to <span class="application">pg_resetxlog</span> not noticing
      that there is an active postmaster using the data directory.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">libpq</span>'s <code class="function">lo_import()</code> and
