   </p><p>    However, several of the issues corrected in this release could have
    resulted in corruption of foreign-key constraints; that is, there
    might now be referencing rows for which there is no matching row in
    the referenced table.  It may be worthwhile to recheck such
    constraints after installing this update.  The simplest way to do that
    is to drop and recreate each suspect constraint; however, that will
    require taking an exclusive lock on both tables, so it is unlikely to
    be acceptable in production databases.  Alternatively, you can do a
    manual join query between the two tables to look for unmatched rows.
   </p><p>    Note also the requirement for replication standby servers to be
    upgraded before their master server is upgraded.
   </p><p>    Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 9.3.2,
    see <a class="xref" href="release-9-3-2.html" title="E.75. Release 9.3.2">Section E.75</a>.

WITH ADMIN OPTION</code> restrictions
      (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      Granting a role without <code class="literal">ADMIN OPTION</code> is supposed to
      prevent the grantee from adding or removing members from the granted
      role, but this restriction was easily bypassed by doing <code class="literal">SET
      ROLE</code> first.  The security impact is mostly that a role member can
      revoke the access of others, contrary to the wishes of his grantor.
      Unapproved role member additions are a lesser concern, since an
      uncooperative role member could provide most of his rights to others
      anyway by creating views or <code class="literal">SECURITY DEFINER</code> functions.

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent privilege escalation via manual calls to PL validator
      functions (Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly
      during <code class="command">CREATE FUNCTION</code>, but they are also normal SQL
      functions that a user can call explicitly.  Calling a validator on
      a function actually written in some other language was not checked
      for and could be exploited for privilege-escalation purposes.
      The fix involves adding a call to a privilege-checking function in
      each validator function.  Non-core procedural languages will also
      need to make this change to their own validator functions, if any.

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid multiple name lookups during table and index DDL
      (Robert Haas, Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      If the name lookups come to different conclusions due to concurrent
      activity, we might perform some parts of the DDL on a different table
      than other parts.  At least in the case of <code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code>,
      this can be used to cause the permissions checks to be performed
      against a different table than the index creation, allowing for a
      privilege escalation attack.
      (CVE-2014-0062)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent buffer overrun with long datetime strings (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      The <code class="literal">MAXDATELEN</code> constant was too small for the longest
      possible value of type <code class="type">interval</code>, allowing a buffer overrun
      in <code class="function">interval_out()</code>.  Although the datetime input
      functions were more careful about avoiding buffer overrun, the limit
      was short enough to cause them to reject some valid inputs, such as
      input containing a very long timezone name.  The <span class="application">ecpg</span>
      library contained these vulnerabilities along with some of its own.
      (CVE-2014-0063)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent buffer overrun due to integer overflow in size calculations
      (Noah Misch, Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      Several functions, mostly type input functions, calculated an
      allocation size without checking for overflow.  If overflow did
      occur, a too-small buffer would be allocated and then written past.
      (CVE-2014-0064)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent overruns of fixed-size buffers
      (Peter Eisentraut, Jozef Mlich)
     </p><p>      Use <code class="function">strlcpy()</code> and related functions to provide a clear
      guarantee that fixed-size buffers are not overrun.  Unlike the
      preceding items, it is unclear whether these cases really represent
      live issues, since in most cases there appear to be previous
      constraints on the size of the input string.  Nonetheless it seems
      prudent to silence all Coverity warnings of this type.

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid crashing if <code class="function">crypt()</code> returns NULL (Honza Horak,
      Bruce Momjian)
     </p><p>      There are relatively few scenarios in which <code class="function">crypt()</code>
      could return NULL, but <code class="filename">contrib/chkpass</code> would crash
      if it did.  One practical case in which this could be an issue is
      if <span class="application">libc</span> is configured to refuse to execute unapproved
      hashing algorithms (e.g., <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">FIPS mode</span>”</span>).

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Document risks of <code class="literal">make check</code> in the regression testing
      instructions (Noah Misch, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Since the temporary server started by <code class="literal">make check</code>
      uses <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">trust</span>”</span> authentication, another user on the same machine
      could connect to it as database superuser, and then potentially
      exploit the privileges of the operating-system user who started the
      tests.  A future release will probably incorporate changes in the
      testing procedure to prevent this risk, but some public discussion is
      needed first.  So for the moment, just warn people against using
      <code class="literal">make check</code> when there are untrusted users on the
      same machine.
      (CVE-2014-0067)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Rework tuple freezing protocol
      (Álvaro Herrera, Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      The logic for tuple freezing was unable to handle some cases involving
      freezing of
      <a class="link" href="routine-vacuuming.html#VACUUM-FOR-MULTIXACT-WRAPAROUND" title="24.1.5.1. Multixacts and Wraparound"><em class="firstterm">multixact</em>
      IDs</a>, with the practical effect that shared row-level locks
      might be forgotten once old enough.
     </p><p>      Fixing this required changing the WAL record format for tuple
      freezing.  While this is no issue for standalone servers, when using
      replication it means that <span class="emphasis"><em>standby servers must be upgraded
      to 9.3.3 or later before their masters are</em></span>.  An older standby will
      be unable to interpret freeze records generated by a newer master, and
      will fail with a PANIC message.  (In such a case, upgrading the
      standby should be sufficient to let it resume execution.)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Create separate GUC parameters to control multixact freezing
      (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      9.3 requires multixact tuple labels to be frozen before
      they grow too old, in the same fashion as plain transaction ID labels
      have been frozen for some time.  Previously, the transaction ID
      freezing parameters were used for multixact IDs too; but since
      the consumption rates of transaction IDs and multixact IDs can be
      quite different, this did not work very well.  Introduce new settings
      <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-client.html#GUC-VACUUM-MULTIXACT-FREEZE-MIN-AGE">vacuum_multixact_freeze_min_age</a>,
      <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-client.html#GUC-VACUUM-MULTIXACT-FREEZE-TABLE-AGE">vacuum_multixact_freeze_table_age</a>, and
      <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-autovacuum.html#GUC-AUTOVACUUM-MULTIXACT-FREEZE-MAX-AGE">autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age</a>
      to control when to freeze multixacts.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Account for remote row locks propagated by local updates
      (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      If a row was locked by transaction A, and transaction B updated it,
      the new version of the row created by B would be locked by A, yet
      visible only to B.  If transaction B then again updated the row, A's
      lock wouldn't get checked, thus possibly allowing B to complete when
      it shouldn't.  This case is new in 9.3 since prior versions did not
      have any types of row locking that would permit another transaction
      to update the row at all.
     </p><p>      This oversight could allow referential integrity checks to give false
      positives (for instance, allow deletes that should have been rejected).
      Applications using the new commands <code class="literal">SELECT FOR KEY SHARE</code>
      and <code class="literal">SELECT FOR NO KEY UPDATE</code> might also have suffered
      locking failures of this kind.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">forgetting</span>”</span> valid row locks when one of several
      holders of a row lock aborts (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      This was yet another mechanism by which a shared row lock could be
      lost, thus possibly allowing updates that should have been prevented
      by foreign-key constraints.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect logic during update chain locking
      (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      This mistake could result in spurious <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">could not serialize access
      due to concurrent update</span>”</span> errors in <code class="literal">REPEATABLE READ</code>
      and <code class="literal">SERIALIZABLE</code> transaction isolation modes.

      of <code class="filename">pg_multixact/members</code>
      (Andres Freund, Álvaro Herrera)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix handling of 5-digit filenames in <code class="filename">pg_multixact/members</code>
      (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      As of 9.3, these names can be more than 4 digits, but the directory
      cleanup code ignored such files.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve performance of multixact cache code
      (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Optimize updating a row that's already locked by the same transaction
      (Andres Freund, Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      This fixes a performance regression from pre-9.3 versions when doing
      <code class="literal">SELECT FOR UPDATE</code> followed by <code class="literal">UPDATE/DELETE</code>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      During archive recovery, prefer highest timeline number when WAL
      segments with the same ID are present in both the archive
      and <code class="filename">pg_xlog/</code> (Kyotaro Horiguchi)
     </p><p>      Previously, not-yet-archived segments could get ignored during
      recovery.  This reverts an undesirable behavioral change in 9.3.0
      back to the way things worked pre-9.3.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix possible mis-replay of WAL records when some segments of a
      relation aren't full size (Greg Stark, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The WAL update could be applied to the wrong page, potentially many
      pages past where it should have been.  Aside from corrupting data,
      this error has been observed to result in significant <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">bloat</span>”</span>
      of standby servers compared to their masters, due to updates being
      applied far beyond where the end-of-file should have been.  This
      failure mode does not appear to be a significant risk during crash
      recovery, only when initially synchronizing a standby created from a
      base backup taken from a quickly-changing master.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix bug in determining when recovery has reached consistency
      (Tomonari Katsumata, Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      In some cases WAL replay would mistakenly conclude that the database
      was already consistent at the start of replay, thus possibly allowing
      hot-standby queries before the database was really consistent.  Other
      symptoms such as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">PANIC: WAL contains references to invalid
      pages</span>”</span> were also possible.

      a <code class="literal">VACUUM</code> operation in hot-standby mode (Andres Freund,

     </p><p>      This is a serious issue for any application making use of statement
      timeouts, as it could cause all manner of strange failures after a
