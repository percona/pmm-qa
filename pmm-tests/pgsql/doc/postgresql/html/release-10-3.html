   </p><p>    However, if you run an installation in which not all users are mutually
    trusting, or if you maintain an application or extension that is
    intended for use in arbitrary situations, it is strongly recommended
    that you read the documentation changes described in the first changelog
    entry below, and take suitable steps to ensure that your installation or
    code is secure.
   </p><p>    Also, the changes described in the second changelog entry below may
    cause functions used in index expressions or materialized views to fail
    during auto-analyze, or when reloading from a dump.  After upgrading,
    monitor the server logs for such problems, and fix affected functions.
   </p><p>    Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 10.2,
    see <a class="xref" href="release-10-2.html" title="E.4. Release 10.2">Section E.4</a>.

      against search-path-dependent trojan-horse attacks from other users
      (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      Using a <code class="varname">search_path</code> setting that includes any
      schemas writable by a hostile user enables that user to capture
      control of queries and then run arbitrary SQL code with the
      permissions of the attacked user.  While it is possible to write
      queries that are proof against such hijacking, it is notationally
      tedious, and it's very easy to overlook holes.  Therefore, we now
      recommend configurations in which no untrusted schemas appear in
      one's search path.  Relevant documentation appears in

      in <span class="application">pg_dump</span> and other client programs
      (Noah Misch, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      <span class="application">pg_dump</span>,
      <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span>,
      <span class="application">vacuumdb</span> and
      other <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>-provided applications were
      themselves vulnerable to the type of hijacking described in the previous
      changelog entry; since these applications are commonly run by
      superusers, they present particularly attractive targets.  To make them
      secure whether or not the installation as a whole has been secured,
      modify them to include only the <code class="structname">pg_catalog</code>
      schema in their <code class="varname">search_path</code> settings.
      Autovacuum worker processes now do the same, as well.
     </p><p>      In cases where user-provided functions are indirectly executed by
      these programs — for example, user-provided functions in index
      expressions — the tighter <code class="varname">search_path</code> may
      result in errors, which will need to be corrected by adjusting those
      user-provided functions to not assume anything about what search path
      they are invoked under.  That has always been good practice, but now
      it will be necessary for correct behavior.

      table of contents, possibly leading to the wrong results in a
      schema-selective restore.  Its ownership was not correctly restored,
      either.  Also, change the logic so that statistics objects are
      dumped/restored, or not, as independent objects rather than tying
      them to the dump/restore decision for the table they are on.  The
      original definition could not scale to the planned future extension to
      cross-table statistics.

      one reached via a SPI query from another PL/Python function) would
      result in a stack trace showing the inner function's name twice,
