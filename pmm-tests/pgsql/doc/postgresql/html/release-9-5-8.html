      protect passwords stored as user mapping options
      (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      The fix for CVE-2017-7486 was incorrect: it allowed a user
      to see the options in her own user mapping, even if she did not
      have <code class="literal">USAGE</code> permission on the associated foreign server.
      Such options might include a password that had been provided by the
      server owner rather than the user herself.
      Since <code class="structname">information_schema.user_mapping_options</code> does not
      show the options in such cases, <code class="structname">pg_user_mappings</code>
      should not either.

     </p><p>      By itself, this patch will only fix the behavior in newly initdb'd

        you'll need to temporarily make it accept connections.

      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      <span class="application">libpq</span> ignores empty password specifications, and does
      not transmit them to the server.  So, if a user's password has been
      set to the empty string, it's impossible to log in with that password
      via <span class="application">psql</span> or other <span class="application">libpq</span>-based
      clients.  An administrator might therefore believe that setting the
      password to empty is equivalent to disabling password login.
      However, with a modified or non-<span class="application">libpq</span>-based client,
      logging in could be possible, depending on which authentication
      method is configured.  In particular the most common
      method, <code class="literal">md5</code>, accepted empty passwords.
      Change the server to reject empty passwords in all cases.

     </p><p>      <code class="function">lo_put()</code> should surely require the same permissions

      servers with <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> (Bruce Momjian)
     </p><p>      The previous documentation instructed users to start/stop the primary
      server after running <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> but before syncing
      the standby servers.  This sequence is unsafe.

     </p><p>      If several sessions concurrently lock a tuple update chain with
      nonconflicting lock modes using an old snapshot, and they all
      succeed, it was possible for some of them to nonetheless fail (and
      conclude there is no live tuple version) due to a race condition.
      This had consequences such as foreign-key checks failing to see a
      tuple that definitely exists but is being updated concurrently.

     </p><p>      Previously, we would rename a conflicting autogenerated array type

      function's argument or return type from <code class="type">opaque</code> to the
      correct type (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      <code class="command">CREATE TYPE</code> updates I/O functions declared in this
      long-obsolete style, but it forgot to record a dependency on the
      type, allowing a subsequent <code class="command">DROP TYPE</code> to leave broken
      function definitions behind.

      a <code class="type">tsvector</code> column (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix unnecessary precision loss and sloppy rounding when multiplying

      such as <code class="function">regprocedurein()</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Depending on the prevailing locale, these functions could

      compiling <span class="application">PL/Perl</span> (Ashutosh Sharma, Tom Lane)

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <span class="application">libpq</span>, reset GSS/SASL and SSPI authentication
      state properly after a failed connection attempt (Michael Paquier)
     </p><p>      Failure to do this meant that when falling back from SSL to non-SSL
      connections, a GSS/SASL failure in the SSL attempt would always cause
      the non-SSL attempt to fail.  SSPI did not fail, but it leaked memory.

      is ended with a keyboard EOF signal and then another <code class="command">COPY
