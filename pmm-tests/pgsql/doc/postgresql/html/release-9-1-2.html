   For information about new features in the 9.1 major release, see

   </p><p>    However, a longstanding error was discovered in the definition of the
    <code class="literal">information_schema.referential_constraints</code> view.  If you
    rely on correct results from that view, you should replace its
    definition as explained in the first changelog item below.
   </p><p>    Also, if you use the <code class="type">citext</code> data type, and you upgraded
    from a previous major release by running <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span>,
    you should run <code class="literal">CREATE EXTENSION citext FROM unpackaged</code>
    to avoid collation-related failures in <code class="type">citext</code> operations.
    The same is necessary if you restore a dump from a pre-9.1 database
    that contains an instance of the <code class="type">citext</code> data type.
    If you've already run the <code class="command">CREATE EXTENSION</code> command before
    upgrading to 9.1.2, you will instead need to do manual catalog updates
    as explained in the second changelog item.

      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This view was being insufficiently careful about matching the
      foreign-key constraint to the depended-on primary or unique key
      constraint.  That could result in failure to show a foreign key
      constraint at all, or showing it multiple times, or claiming that it
      depends on a different constraint than the one it really does.
     </p><p>      Since the view definition is installed by <span class="application">initdb</span>,
      merely upgrading will not fix the problem.  If you need to fix this
      in an existing installation, you can (as a superuser) drop the
      <code class="literal">information_schema</code> schema then re-create it by sourcing
      <code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>SHAREDIR</code></em>/information_schema.sql</code>.
      (Run <code class="literal">pg_config --sharedir</code> if you're uncertain where
      <em class="replaceable"><code>SHAREDIR</code></em> is.)  This must be repeated in each database
      to be fixed.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Make <code class="filename">contrib/citext</code>'s upgrade script fix collations of
      <code class="type">citext</code> columns and indexes (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Existing <code class="type">citext</code> columns and indexes aren't correctly marked as
      being of a collatable data type during <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> from
      a pre-9.1 server, or when a pre-9.1 dump containing the <code class="type">citext</code>
      type is loaded into a 9.1 server.
      That leads to operations on these columns failing with errors
      such as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">could not determine which collation to use for string
      comparison</span>”</span>.  This change allows them to be fixed by the same
      script that upgrades the <code class="type">citext</code> module into a proper 9.1
      extension during <code class="literal">CREATE EXTENSION citext FROM unpackaged</code>.
     </p><p>      If you have a previously-upgraded database that is suffering from this
      problem, and you already ran the <code class="command">CREATE EXTENSION</code> command,
      you can manually run (as superuser) the <code class="command">UPDATE</code> commands
      found at the end of
      <code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>SHAREDIR</code></em>/extension/citext--unpackaged--1.0.sql</code>.
      (Run <code class="literal">pg_config --sharedir</code> if you're uncertain where
      <em class="replaceable"><code>SHAREDIR</code></em> is.)
      There is no harm in doing this again if unsure.

      joins to the output of a scalar-returning function (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      A crash could only occur if the target row had been concurrently
      updated, so this problem surfaced only intermittently.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect replay of WAL records for GIN index updates
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This could result in transiently failing to find index entries after
      a crash, or on a hot-standby server.  The problem would be repaired
      by the next <code class="command">VACUUM</code> of the index, however.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix TOAST-related data corruption during <code class="literal">CREATE TABLE dest AS
      SELECT * FROM src</code> or <code class="literal">INSERT INTO dest SELECT * FROM src</code>
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      If a table has been modified by <code class="command">ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN</code>,
      attempts to copy its data verbatim to another table could produce
      corrupt results in certain corner cases.
      The problem can only manifest in this precise form in 8.4 and later,
      but we patched earlier versions as well in case there are other code
      paths that could trigger the same bug.

      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The typical symptom was transient errors like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">missing chunk
      number 0 for toast value NNNNN in pg_toast_2619</span>”</span>, where the cited
      toast table would always belong to a system catalog.

      expressions (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Previously, a referenced object could be dropped without having dropped
      or modified the function, leading to misbehavior when the function was
      used.  Note that merely installing this update will not fix the missing
      dependency entries; to do that, you'd need to <code class="command">CREATE OR
      REPLACE</code> each such function afterwards.  If you have functions whose
      defaults depend on non-built-in objects, doing so is recommended.

      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This bug is known to lead to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">variable not found in subplan target
      list</span>”</span> planner errors, and could possibly result in wrong query output
      when outer joins are involved.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix window functions that sort by expressions involving aggregates

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix index matching for operators with both collatable and noncollatable
      inputs (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      In 9.1.0, an indexable operator that has a non-collatable left-hand
      input type and a collatable right-hand input type would not be
      recognized as matching the left-hand column's index.  An example is
      the <code class="type">hstore</code> <code class="literal">?</code> <code class="type">text</code> operator.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Allow inlining of set-returning SQL functions with multiple OUT
      parameters (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Don't trust deferred-unique indexes for join removal (Tom Lane and Marti
      Raudsepp)
     </p><p>      A deferred uniqueness constraint might not hold intra-transaction,
      so assuming that it does could give incorrect query results.

      header, and add a new macro, <code class="function">DatumGetInetPP()</code>, that does
      not (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      This change affects no core code, but might prevent crashes in add-on
      code that expects <code class="function">DatumGetInetP()</code> to produce an unpacked
      datum as per usual convention.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve locale support in <code class="type">money</code> type's input and output
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Aside from not supporting all standard
      <a class="link" href="runtime-config-client.html#GUC-LC-MONETARY"><code class="varname">lc_monetary</code></a>
      formatting options, the input and output functions were inconsistent,
      meaning there were locales in which dumped <code class="type">money</code> values could
      not be re-read.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Don't let <a class="link" href="runtime-config-compatible.html#GUC-TRANSFORM-NULL-EQUALS"><code class="varname">transform_null_equals</code></a>
      affect <code class="literal">CASE foo WHEN NULL ...</code> constructs
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      <code class="varname">transform_null_equals</code> is only supposed to affect
      <code class="literal">foo = NULL</code> expressions written directly by the user, not
      equality checks generated internally by this form of <code class="literal">CASE</code>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Change foreign-key trigger creation order to better support
      self-referential foreign keys (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      For a cascading foreign key that references its own table, a row update
      will fire both the <code class="literal">ON UPDATE</code> trigger and the
      <code class="literal">CHECK</code> trigger as one event.  The <code class="literal">ON UPDATE</code>
      trigger must execute first, else the <code class="literal">CHECK</code> will check a
      non-final state of the row and possibly throw an inappropriate error.
      However, the firing order of these triggers is determined by their
      names, which generally sort in creation order since the triggers have
      auto-generated names following the convention
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">RI_ConstraintTrigger_NNNN</span>”</span>.  A proper fix would require
      modifying that convention, which we will do in 9.2, but it seems risky
      to change it in existing releases.  So this patch just changes the
      creation order of the triggers.  Users encountering this type of error
      should drop and re-create the foreign key constraint to get its
      triggers into the right order.

      9.1.0 would throw an error if that statement returned a reference.
      Also, make sure it works to return a string value for a composite type,
      so long as the string meets the type's input format.
      In addition, throw errors for attempts to return Perl arrays or hashes
      when the function's declared result type is not an array or composite
      type, respectively.  (Pre-9.1 versions rather uselessly returned
