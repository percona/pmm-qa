      (Bruce Momjian)
     </p><p>      When <code class="function">to_char()</code> processes a numeric formatting template
      calling for a large number of digits, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
      would read past the end of a buffer.  When processing a crafted
      timestamp formatting template, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> would write
      past the end of a buffer.  Either case could crash the server.
      We have not ruled out the possibility of attacks that lead to
      privilege escalation, though they seem unlikely.
      (CVE-2015-0241)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix buffer overrun in replacement <code class="function">*printf()</code> functions
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> includes a replacement implementation
      of <code class="function">printf</code> and related functions.  This code will overrun
      a stack buffer when formatting a floating point number (conversion
      specifiers <code class="literal">e</code>, <code class="literal">E</code>, <code class="literal">f</code>, <code class="literal">F</code>,
      <code class="literal">g</code> or <code class="literal">G</code>) with requested precision greater than
      about 500.  This will crash the server, and we have not ruled out the
      possibility of attacks that lead to privilege escalation.
      A database user can trigger such a buffer overrun through
      the <code class="function">to_char()</code> SQL function.  While that is the only
      affected core <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> functionality, extension
      modules that use printf-family functions may be at risk as well.
     </p><p>      This issue primarily affects <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> on Windows.
      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> uses the system implementation of these
      functions where adequate, which it is on other modern platforms.

      (Marko Tiikkaja, Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      Errors in memory size tracking within the <code class="filename">pgcrypto</code>
      module permitted stack buffer overruns and improper dependence on the
      contents of uninitialized memory.  The buffer overrun cases can
      crash the server, and we have not ruled out the possibility of
      attacks that lead to privilege escalation.

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix possible loss of frontend/backend protocol synchronization after
      an error
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      If any error occurred while the server was in the middle of reading a
      protocol message from the client, it could lose synchronization and
      incorrectly try to interpret part of the message's data as a new
      protocol message.  An attacker able to submit crafted binary data
      within a command parameter might succeed in injecting his own SQL
      commands this way.  Statement timeout and query cancellation are the
      most likely sources of errors triggering this scenario.  Particularly
      vulnerable are applications that use a timeout and also submit
      arbitrary user-crafted data as binary query parameters.  Disabling
      statement timeout will reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of
      exploit.  Our thanks to Emil Lenngren for reporting this issue.
      (CVE-2015-0244)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix information leak via constraint-violation error messages
      (Stephen Frost)
     </p><p>      Some server error messages show the values of columns that violate
      a constraint, such as a unique constraint.  If the user does not have
      <code class="literal">SELECT</code> privilege on all columns of the table, this could
      mean exposing values that the user should not be able to see.  Adjust
      the code so that values are displayed only when they came from the SQL
      command or could be selected by the user.

      (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      Use SSPI authentication to allow connections only from the OS user
      who launched the test suite.  This closes on Windows the same
      vulnerability previously closed on other platforms, namely that other
      users might be able to connect to the test postmaster.

      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      Non-ASCII locale names are problematic since it's not clear what
      encoding they should be represented in.  Map the troublesome locale
      name to a plain-ASCII alias, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Norwegian_Norway</span>”</span>.

      shortly later move it back to its original tablespace (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid corrupting tables when <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> inside a transaction
      is rolled back (Andres Freund, Tom Lane, Michael Paquier)
     </p><p>      If the failing transaction had earlier removed the last index, rule, or
      trigger from the table, the table would be left in a corrupted state
      with the relevant <code class="structname">pg_class</code> flags not set though they
      should be.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that unlogged tables are copied correctly

      case where a table column is recursively visited before its table
      (Petr Jelinek, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This case is only known to arise when an extension creates both a
      datatype and a table using that datatype.  The faulty code might
      refuse a <code class="command">DROP EXTENSION</code> unless <code class="literal">CASCADE</code> is
      specified, which should not be required.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix use-of-already-freed-memory problem in EvalPlanQual processing
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      In <code class="literal">READ COMMITTED</code> mode, queries that lock or update
      recently-updated rows could crash as a result of this bug.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid possible deadlock while trying to acquire tuple locks
      in EvalPlanQual processing (Álvaro Herrera, Mark Kirkwood)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix failure to wait when a transaction tries to acquire a <code class="literal">FOR

      currently hold <code class="literal">FOR SHARE</code> locks (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix planning of <code class="command">SELECT FOR UPDATE</code> when using a partial
      index on a child table (Kyotaro Horiguchi)
     </p><p>      In <code class="literal">READ COMMITTED</code> mode, <code class="command">SELECT FOR UPDATE</code> must
      also recheck the partial index's <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition when
      rechecking a recently-updated row to see if it still satisfies the
      query's <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition.  This requirement was missed if the
      index belonged to an inheritance child table, so that it was possible
      to incorrectly return rows that no longer satisfy the query condition.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix corner case wherein <code class="command">SELECT FOR UPDATE</code> could return a row
      twice, and possibly miss returning other rows (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      In <code class="literal">READ COMMITTED</code> mode, a <code class="command">SELECT FOR UPDATE</code>
      that is scanning an inheritance tree could incorrectly return a row
      from a prior child table instead of the one it should return from a
      later child table.

      a <code class="literal">FOREIGN KEY</code> declaration (David Rowley)
     </p><p>      This restriction is per SQL standard.  Previously we did not reject
      the case explicitly, but later on the code would fail with
      bizarre-looking errors.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Re-enable error for <code class="literal">SELECT ... OFFSET -1</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      A negative offset value has been an error since 8.4, but an
      optimization added in 9.3 accidentally turned the case into a no-op.
      Restore the expected behavior.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Restore previous behavior of conversion of domains to JSON
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This change causes domains over numeric and boolean to be treated
      like their base types for purposes of conversion to JSON.  It worked
      like that before 9.3.5 and 9.2.9, but was unintentionally changed
      while fixing a related problem.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="function">json_agg()</code> to not return extra trailing right
      brackets in its result (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix bugs in raising a <code class="type">numeric</code> value to a large integral power
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The previous code could get a wrong answer, or consume excessive
      amounts of time and memory before realizing that the answer must
      overflow.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <code class="function">numeric_recv()</code>, truncate away any fractional digits
      that would be hidden according to the value's <code class="literal">dscale</code> field
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      A <code class="type">numeric</code> value's display scale (<code class="literal">dscale</code>) should
      never be less than the number of nonzero fractional digits; but
      apparently there's at least one broken client application that
      transmits binary <code class="type">numeric</code> values in which that's true.
      This leads to strange behavior since the extra digits are taken into
      account by arithmetic operations even though they aren't printed.
      The least risky fix seems to be to truncate away such <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">hidden</span>”</span>
      digits on receipt, so that the value is indeed what it prints as.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect search for shortest-first regular expression matches
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Matching would often fail when the number of allowed iterations is
      limited by a <code class="literal">?</code> quantifier or a bound expression.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Reject out-of-range numeric timezone specifications (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Simple numeric timezone specifications exceeding +/- 168 hours (one
      week) would be accepted, but could then cause null-pointer dereference
      crashes in certain operations.  There's no use-case for such large UTC
      offsets, so reject them.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix bugs in <code class="type">tsquery</code> <code class="literal">@&gt;</code> <code class="type">tsquery</code>
      operator (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      Two different terms would be considered to match if they had the same
      CRC.  Also, if the second operand had more terms than the first, it
      would be assumed not to be contained in the first; which is wrong
      since it might contain duplicate terms.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve ispell dictionary's defenses against bad affix files (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Allow more than 64K phrases in a thesaurus dictionary (David Boutin)
     </p><p>      The previous coding could crash on an oversize dictionary, so this was
      deemed a back-patchable bug fix rather than a feature addition.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix namespace handling in <code class="function">xpath()</code> (Ali Akbar)
     </p><p>      Previously, the <code class="type">xml</code> value resulting from
      an <code class="function">xpath()</code> call would not have namespace declarations if
      the namespace declarations were attached to an ancestor element in the
      input <code class="type">xml</code> value, rather than to the specific element being
      returned.  Propagate the ancestral declaration so that the result is
      correct when considered in isolation.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that whole-row variables expose nonempty column names
      to functions that pay attention to column names within composite
      arguments (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      In some contexts, constructs like <code class="literal">row_to_json(tab.*)</code> may
      not produce the expected column names.  This is fixed properly as of
      9.4; in older branches, just ensure that we produce some nonempty
      name.  (In some cases this will be the underlying table's column name
      rather than the query-assigned alias that should theoretically be
      visible.)

     </p><p>      In some cases, <code class="literal">= ANY</code> conditions applied to non-first index

     </p><p>      The previous behavior resulted in basically ignoring these per-table
      settings, which was unintended.  Now, a table having such settings
      will be vacuumed using those settings, independently of what is going
      on in other autovacuum workers.  This may result in heavier total I/O
      load than before, so such settings should be re-examined for sanity.

     </p><p>      Even when autovacuum is nominally off, we will still launch autovacuum
      worker processes to vacuum tables that are at risk of XID wraparound.
      However, such a worker process then proceeded to vacuum all tables in
      the target database, if they met the usual thresholds for
      autovacuuming.  This is at best pretty unexpected; at worst it delays
      response to the wraparound threat.  Fix it so that if autovacuum is
      turned off, workers <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> do anti-wraparound vacuums and

     </p><p>      When using libedit rather than readline, <code class="command">\s</code> printed the
      command history in a fairly unreadable encoded format, and on recent
      libedit versions might fail altogether.  Fix that by printing the
      history ourselves rather than having the library do it.  A pleasant
      side-effect is that the pager is used if appropriate.
     </p><p>      This patch also fixes a bug that caused newline encoding to be applied
      inconsistently when saving the command history with libedit.
      Multiline history entries written by older <span class="application">psql</span>

     </p><p>      Previously, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> assumed that the UTC offset
      associated with a time zone abbreviation (such as <code class="literal">EST</code>)
      never changes in the usage of any particular locale.  However this
      assumption fails in the real world, so introduce the ability for a
      zone abbreviation to represent a UTC offset that sometimes changes.
      Update the zone abbreviation definition files to make use of this
      feature in timezone locales that have changed the UTC offset of their
      abbreviations since 1970 (according to the IANA timezone database).
      In such timezones, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> will now associate the
      correct UTC offset with the abbreviation depending on the given date.

      Remove references to ADT as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Arabia Daylight Time</span>”</span>, an

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Update time zone data files to <span class="application">tzdata</span> release 2015a.
     </p><p>      The IANA timezone database has adopted abbreviations of the form
      <code class="literal">A<em class="replaceable"><code>x</code></em>ST</code>/<code class="literal">A<em class="replaceable"><code>x</code></em>DT</code>
      for all Australian time zones, reflecting what they believe to be
      current majority practice Down Under.  These names do not conflict
      with usage elsewhere (other than ACST for Acre Summer Time, which has
      been in disuse since 1994).  Accordingly, adopt these names into
      our <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Default</span>”</span> timezone abbreviation set.
      The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Australia</span>”</span> abbreviation set now contains only CST, EAST,
      EST, SAST, SAT, and WST, all of which are thought to be mostly
      historical usage.  Note that SAST has also been changed to be South
      Africa Standard Time in the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Default</span>”</span> abbreviation set.
     </p><p>      Also, add zone abbreviations SRET (Asia/Srednekolymsk) and XJT
      (Asia/Urumqi), and use WSST/WSDT for western Samoa.  Also, there were
      DST law changes in Chile, Mexico, the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands
      (America/Grand_Turk), and Fiji.  There is a new zone
      Pacific/Bougainville for portions of Papua New Guinea.  Also, numerous
      corrections for historical (pre-1970) time zone data.
