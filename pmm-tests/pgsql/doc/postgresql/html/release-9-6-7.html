      by <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> are non-world-readable
      (Tom Lane, Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> normally restricts its
      temporary files to be readable and writable only by the calling user.
      But the temporary file containing <code class="literal">pg_dumpall -g</code>
      output would be group- or world-readable, or even writable, if the
      user's <code class="literal">umask</code> setting allows.  In typical usage on
      multi-user machines, the <code class="literal">umask</code> and/or the working
      directory's permissions would be tight enough to prevent problems;
      but there may be people using <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span>
      in scenarios where this oversight would permit disclosure of database
      passwords to unfriendly eyes.

      (Andres Freund, Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      In some cases <code class="command">VACUUM</code> would fail to remove such
      tuples even though they are now dead, leading to assorted data
      corruption scenarios.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that vacuum will always clean up the pending-insertions list of
      a GIN index (Masahiko Sawada)
     </p><p>      This is necessary to ensure that dead index entries get removed.
      The old code got it backwards, allowing vacuum to skip the cleanup if
      some other process were running cleanup concurrently, thus risking
      invalid entries being left behind in the index.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix inadequate buffer locking in some LSN fetches (Jacob Champion,
      Asim Praveen, Ashwin Agrawal)
     </p><p>      These errors could result in misbehavior under concurrent load.
      The potential consequences have not been characterized fully.

      subqueries whose outputs are used in <code class="literal">GROUPING SETS</code>
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid unnecessary failure in a query on an inheritance tree that
      occurs concurrently with some child table being removed from the tree
      by <code class="command">ALTER TABLE NO INHERIT</code> (Tom Lane)

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix failures when an inheritance tree contains foreign child tables
      (Etsuro Fujita)
     </p><p>      A mix of regular and foreign tables in an inheritance tree resulted in
      creation of incorrect plans for <code class="command">UPDATE</code>
      and <code class="command">DELETE</code> queries.  This led to visible failures in
      some cases, notably when there are row-level triggers on a foreign
      child table.

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix logical decoding to correctly clean up disk files for crashed
      transactions (Atsushi Torikoshi)
     </p><p>      Logical decoding may spill WAL records to disk for transactions
      generating many WAL records.  Normally these files are cleaned up
      after the transaction's commit or abort record arrives; but if
      no such record is ever seen, the removal code misbehaved.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix walsender timeout failure and failure to respond to interrupts
      when processing a large transaction (Petr Jelinek)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="function">has_sequence_privilege()</code> to
      support <code class="literal">WITH GRANT OPTION</code> tests,
      as other privilege-testing functions do (Joe Conway)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In databases using UTF8 encoding, ignore any XML declaration that
      asserts a different encoding (Pavel Stehule, Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      We always store XML strings in the database encoding, so allowing
      libxml to act on a declaration of another encoding gave wrong results.
      In encodings other than UTF8, we don't promise to support non-ASCII
      XML data anyway, so retain the previous behavior for bug compatibility.
      This change affects only <code class="function">xpath()</code> and related
      functions; other XML code paths already acted this way.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Provide for forward compatibility with future minor protocol versions
      (Robert Haas, Badrul Chowdhury)
     </p><p>      Up to now, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> servers simply
      rejected requests to use protocol versions newer than 3.0, so that
      there was no functional difference between the major and minor parts
      of the protocol version number.  Allow clients to request versions 3.x
      without failing, sending back a message showing that the server only
      understands 3.0.  This makes no difference at the moment, but
      back-patching this change should allow speedier introduction of future
      minor protocol upgrades.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Cope with failure to start a parallel worker process
      (Amit Kapila, Robert Haas)
     </p><p>      Parallel query previously tended to hang indefinitely if a worker
      could not be started, as the result of <code class="literal">fork()</code>
      failure or other low-probability problems.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix collection of <code class="command">EXPLAIN</code> statistics from parallel
      workers (Amit Kapila, Thomas Munro)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid unsafe alignment assumptions when working
      with <code class="type">__int128</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Typically, compilers assume that <code class="type">__int128</code> variables are
      aligned on 16-byte boundaries, but our memory allocation
      infrastructure isn't prepared to guarantee that, and increasing the
      setting of MAXALIGN seems infeasible for multiple reasons.  Adjust the
      code to allow use of <code class="type">__int128</code> only when we can tell the
      compiler to assume lesser alignment.  The only known symptom of this
      problem so far is crashes in some parallel aggregation queries.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent stack-overflow crashes when planning extremely deeply
      nested set operations
      (<code class="literal">UNION</code>/<code class="literal">INTERSECT</code>/<code class="literal">EXCEPT</code>)
      (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix null-pointer crashes for some types of LDAP URLs appearing
      in <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> (Thomas Munro)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix sample <code class="function">INSTR()</code> functions in the PL/pgSQL
      documentation (Yugo Nagata, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      These functions are stated to
      be <span class="trademark">Oracle</span>® compatible, but
      they weren't exactly.  In particular, there was a discrepancy in the
      interpretation of a negative third parameter: Oracle thinks that a
      negative value indicates the last place where the target substring can
      begin, whereas our functions took it as the last place where the
      target can end.  Also, Oracle throws an error for a zero or negative
      fourth parameter, whereas our functions returned zero.
     </p><p>      The sample code has been adjusted to match Oracle's behavior more
      precisely.  Users who have copied this code into their applications
      may wish to update their copies.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">pg_dump</span> to make ACL (permissions),
      comment, and security label entries reliably identifiable in archive
      output formats (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">tag</span>”</span> portion of an ACL archive entry was usually
      just the name of the associated object.  Make it start with the object
      type instead, bringing ACLs into line with the convention already used
      for comment and security label archive entries.  Also, fix the
      comment and security label entries for the whole database, if present,
      to make their tags start with <code class="literal">DATABASE</code> so that they
      also follow this convention.  This prevents false matches in code that
      tries to identify large-object-related entries by seeing if the tag
      starts with <code class="literal">LARGE OBJECT</code>.  That could have resulted
      in misclassifying entries as data rather than schema, with undesirable
      results in a schema-only or data-only dump.
     </p><p>      Note that this change has user-visible results in the output
      of <code class="command">pg_restore --list</code>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Rename <span class="application">pg_rewind</span>'s
      <code class="function">copy_file_range</code> function to avoid conflict
      with new Linux system call of that name (Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      This change prevents build failures with newer glibc versions.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <span class="application">ecpg</span>, detect indicator arrays that do
      not have the correct length and report an error (David Rader)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Change the behavior of <code class="filename">contrib/cube</code>'s
      <code class="type">cube</code> <code class="literal">~&gt;</code> <code class="type">int</code>
      operator to make it compatible with KNN search (Alexander Korotkov)
     </p><p>      The meaning of the second argument (the dimension selector) has been
      changed to make it predictable which value is selected even when
      dealing with cubes of varying dimensionalities.
     </p><p>      This is an incompatible change, but since the point of the operator
      was to be used in KNN searches, it seems rather useless as-is.
      After installing this update, any expression indexes or materialized
      views using this operator will need to be reindexed/refreshed.
