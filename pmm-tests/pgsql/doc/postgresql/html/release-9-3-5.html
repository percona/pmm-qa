   </p><p>    However, this release corrects a logic error
    in <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span>, as well as an index corruption problem in
    some GiST indexes.  See the first two changelog entries below to find out
    whether your installation has been affected and what steps you should take
    if so.

      left behind by <span class="application">initdb</span> (Bruce Momjian)
     </p><p>      If you used a pre-9.3.5 version of <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> to
      upgrade a database cluster to 9.3, it might have left behind a file
      <code class="filename">$PGDATA/pg_multixact/offsets/0000</code> that should not be
      there and will eventually cause problems in <code class="command">VACUUM</code>.
      <span class="emphasis"><em>However, in common cases this file is actually valid and
      must not be removed.</em></span>
      To determine whether your installation has this problem, run this
      query as superuser, in any database of the cluster:
</p><pre class="programlisting">WITH list(file) AS (SELECT * FROM pg_ls_dir('pg_multixact/offsets'))
SELECT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM list WHERE file = '0000') AND
       NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM list WHERE file = '0001') AND
       NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM list WHERE file = 'FFFF') AND
       EXISTS (SELECT * FROM list WHERE file != '0000')
       AS file_0000_removal_required;</pre><p>
      If this query returns <code class="literal">t</code>, manually remove the file
      <code class="filename">$PGDATA/pg_multixact/offsets/0000</code>.
      Do nothing if the query returns <code class="literal">f</code>.

      indexes on <code class="type">bit</code> columns (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      This error could result in incorrect query results due to values that
      should compare equal not being seen as equal.
      Users with GiST indexes on <code class="type">bit</code> or <code class="type">bit varying</code>
      columns should <code class="command">REINDEX</code> those indexes after installing this
      update.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Protect against torn pages when deleting GIN list pages (Heikki
      Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      This fix prevents possible index corruption if a system crash occurs
      while the page update is being written to disk.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Don't clear the right-link of a GiST index page while replaying
      updates from WAL (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      This error could lead to transiently wrong answers from GiST index
      scans performed in Hot Standby.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix corner-case infinite loop during insertion into an SP-GiST text
      index (Tom Lane)

      with <code class="literal">-|-</code> (range adjacency) operator
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix wraparound handling for <code class="filename">pg_multixact/members</code>
      (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Truncate <code class="structname">pg_multixact</code> during checkpoints, not
      during <code class="command">VACUUM</code> (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      This change ensures that <code class="structname">pg_multixact</code> segments can't be
      removed if they'd still be needed during WAL replay after a crash.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix possible inconsistency of all-visible flags after WAL recovery
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix possibly-incorrect cache invalidation during nested calls
      to <code class="function">ReceiveSharedInvalidMessages</code> (Andres Freund)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix race condition when updating a tuple concurrently locked by
      another process (Andres Freund, Álvaro Herrera)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">could not find pathkey item to sort</span>”</span> planner failures
      with <code class="literal">UNION ALL</code> over subqueries reading from tables with
      inheritance children (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Don't assume a subquery's output is unique if there's a set-returning
      function in its targetlist (David Rowley)
     </p><p>      This oversight could lead to misoptimization of constructs
      like <code class="literal">WHERE x IN (SELECT y, generate_series(1,10) FROM t GROUP
      BY y)</code>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve planner to drop constant-NULL inputs
      of <code class="literal">AND</code>/<code class="literal">OR</code> when possible (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This change fixes some cases where the more aggressive parameter
      substitution done by 9.2 and later can lead to a worse plan than
      older versions produced.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that the planner sees equivalent <code class="literal">VARIADIC</code> and
      non-<code class="literal">VARIADIC</code> function calls as equivalent (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This bug could for example result in failure to use expression indexes
      involving variadic functions.  It might be necessary to re-create such
      indexes, and/or re-create views including variadic function calls that
      should match the indexes, for the fix to be effective for existing 9.3
      installations.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix handling of nested <code class="type">JSON</code> objects
      in <code class="function">json_populate_recordset()</code> and friends
      (Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      A nested <code class="type">JSON</code> object could result in previous fields of the
      parent object not being shown in the output.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix identification of input type category in <code class="function">to_json()</code>
      and friends (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This is known to have led to inadequate quoting of <code class="type">money</code>
      fields in the <code class="type">JSON</code> result, and there may have been wrong
      results for other data types as well.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix failure to detoast fields in composite elements of structured
      types (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This corrects cases where TOAST pointers could be copied into other
      tables without being dereferenced.  If the original data is later
      deleted, it would lead to errors like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">missing chunk number 0
      for toast value ...</span>”</span> when the now-dangling pointer is used.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">record type has not been registered</span>”</span> failures with
      whole-row references to the output of Append plan nodes (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix possible crash when invoking a user-defined function while
      rewinding a cursor (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix query-lifespan memory leak while evaluating the arguments for a
      function in <code class="literal">FROM</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix session-lifespan memory leaks in regular-expression processing
      (Tom Lane, Arthur O'Dwyer, Greg Stark)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix data encoding error in <code class="filename">hungarian.stop</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent foreign tables from being created with OIDS
      when <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-compatible.html#GUC-DEFAULT-WITH-OIDS">default_with_oids</a> is true
      (Etsuro Fujita)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix liveness checks for rows that were inserted in the current
      transaction and then deleted by a now-rolled-back subtransaction
      (Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      This could cause problems (at least spurious warnings, and at worst an
      infinite loop) if <code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code> or <code class="command">CLUSTER</code> were
      done later in the same transaction.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Clear <code class="structname">pg_stat_activity</code>.<code class="structfield">xact_start</code>
      during <code class="command">PREPARE TRANSACTION</code> (Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      After the <code class="command">PREPARE</code>, the originating session is no longer in
      a transaction, so it should not continue to display a transaction
      start time.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="command">REASSIGN OWNED</code> to not fail for text search objects
      (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent <code class="structname">pg_class</code>.<code class="structfield">relminmxid</code> values from
      going backwards during <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code> (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Reduce indentation in rule/view dumps to improve readability and avoid
      excessive whitespace (Greg Stark, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This change reduces the amount of indentation applied to nested
      constructs, including some cases that the user probably doesn't think
      of as nested, such as UNION lists.  Previously, deeply nested
      constructs were printed with an amount of whitespace growing as
      O(N^2), which created a performance problem and even risk of
      out-of-memory failures.  Now the indentation is reduced modulo 40,
      which is initially odd to look at but seems to preserve readability
      better than simply limiting the indentation would do.
      Redundant parenthesization of UNION lists has been reduced as well.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix dumping of rules/views when subsequent addition of a column has
      resulted in multiple input columns matching a <code class="literal">USING</code>
      specification (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Repair view printing for some cases involving functions
      in <code class="literal">FROM</code> that return a composite type containing dropped
      columns (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Block signals during postmaster startup (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This ensures that the postmaster will properly clean up after itself
      if, for example, it receives <span class="systemitem">SIGINT</span> while still
      starting up.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix client host name lookup when processing <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code>
      entries that specify host names instead of IP addresses (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Ensure that reverse-DNS lookup failures are reported, instead of just
      silently not matching such entries.  Also ensure that we make only
      one reverse-DNS lookup attempt per connection, not one per host name
      entry, which is what previously happened if the lookup attempts failed.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Allow the root user to use <code class="literal">postgres -C variable</code> and
      <code class="literal">postgres --describe-config</code> (MauMau)
     </p><p>      The prohibition on starting the server as root does not need to extend
      to these operations, and relaxing it prevents failure
      of <span class="application">pg_ctl</span> in some scenarios.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Secure Unix-domain sockets of temporary postmasters started during
      <code class="literal">make check</code> (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      Any local user able to access the socket file could connect as the
      server's bootstrap superuser, then proceed to execute arbitrary code as
      the operating-system user running the test, as we previously noted in
      CVE-2014-0067.  This change defends against that risk by placing the
      server's socket in a temporary, mode 0700 subdirectory
      of <code class="filename">/tmp</code>.  The hazard remains however on platforms where
      Unix sockets are not supported, notably Windows, because then the
      temporary postmaster must accept local TCP connections.
     </p><p>      A useful side effect of this change is to simplify
      <code class="literal">make check</code> testing in builds that
      override <code class="literal">DEFAULT_PGSOCKET_DIR</code>.  Popular non-default values
      like <code class="filename">/var/run/postgresql</code> are often not writable by the
      build user, requiring workarounds that will no longer be necessary.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix tablespace creation WAL replay to work on Windows (MauMau)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix detection of socket creation failures on Windows (Bruce Momjian)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      On Windows, allow new sessions to absorb values of PGC_BACKEND
      parameters (such as <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-logging.html#GUC-LOG-CONNECTIONS">log_connections</a>) from the
      configuration file (Amit Kapila)
     </p><p>      Previously, if such a parameter were changed in the file post-startup,
      the change would have no effect.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Properly quote executable path names on Windows (Nikhil Deshpande)
     </p><p>      This oversight could cause <span class="application">initdb</span>
      and <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> to fail on Windows, if the installation
      path contained both spaces and <code class="literal">@</code> signs.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix linking of <span class="application">libpython</span> on macOS (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The method we previously used can fail with the Python library
      supplied by Xcode 5.0 and later.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid buffer bloat in <span class="application">libpq</span> when the server
      consistently sends data faster than the client can absorb it
      (Shin-ichi Morita, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      <span class="application">libpq</span> could be coerced into enlarging its input buffer
      until it runs out of memory (which would be reported misleadingly
      as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">lost synchronization with server</span>”</span>).  Under ordinary
      circumstances it's quite far-fetched that data could be continuously
      transmitted more quickly than the <code class="function">recv()</code> loop can
      absorb it, but this has been observed when the client is artificially
      slowed by scheduler constraints.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that LDAP lookup attempts in <span class="application">libpq</span> time out as
      intended (Laurenz Albe)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">ecpg</span> to do the right thing when an array
      of <code class="type">char *</code> is the target for a FETCH statement returning more
      than one row, as well as some other array-handling fixes
      (Ashutosh Bapat)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">pg_dump</span> to cope with a materialized view that
      depends on a table's primary key (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This occurs if the view's query relies on functional dependency to
      abbreviate a <code class="literal">GROUP BY</code> list.  <span class="application">pg_dump</span> got
      sufficiently confused that it dumped the materialized view as a
      regular view.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix parsing of <span class="application">pg_dumpall</span>'s <code class="option">-i</code> switch
      (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">pg_restore</span>'s processing of old-style large object
      comments (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      A direct-to-database restore from an archive file generated by a
      pre-9.0 version of <span class="application">pg_dump</span> would usually fail if the
      archive contained more than a few comments for large objects.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> for cases where the new server creates
      a TOAST table but the old version did not (Bruce Momjian)
     </p><p>      This rare situation would manifest as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">relation OID mismatch</span>”</span>
      errors.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span>,
      preserve <code class="structname">pg_database</code>.<code class="structfield">datminmxid</code>
      and <code class="structname">pg_class</code>.<code class="structfield">relminmxid</code> values from the
      old cluster, or insert reasonable values when upgrading from pre-9.3;
      also defend against unreasonable values in the core server
      (Bruce Momjian, Álvaro Herrera, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      These changes prevent scenarios in which autovacuum might insist on
      scanning the entire cluster's contents immediately upon starting the
      new cluster, or in which tracking of unfrozen MXID values might be
      disabled completely.
