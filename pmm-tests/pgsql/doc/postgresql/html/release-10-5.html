      between connection attempts (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      An unprivileged user of <code class="filename">dblink</code>
      or <code class="filename">postgres_fdw</code> could bypass the checks intended
      to prevent use of server-side credentials, such as
      a <code class="filename">~/.pgpass</code> file owned by the operating-system
      user running the server.  Servers allowing peer authentication on
      local connections are particularly vulnerable.  Other attacks such
      as SQL injection into a <code class="filename">postgres_fdw</code> session
      are also possible.
      Attacking <code class="filename">postgres_fdw</code> in this way requires the
      ability to create a foreign server object with selected connection
      parameters, but any user with access to <code class="filename">dblink</code>
      could exploit the problem.
      In general, an attacker with the ability to select the connection
      parameters for a <span class="application">libpq</span>-using application
      could cause mischief, though other plausible attack scenarios are
      harder to think of.
      Our thanks to Andrew Krasichkov for reporting this issue.

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="literal">INSERT ... ON CONFLICT UPDATE</code> through a view
      that isn't just <code class="literal">SELECT * FROM ...</code>
      (Dean Rasheed, Amit Langote)
     </p><p>      Erroneous expansion of an updatable view could lead to crashes
      or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">attribute ... has the wrong type</span>”</span> errors, if the
      view's <code class="literal">SELECT</code> list doesn't match one-to-one with
      the underlying table's columns.
      Furthermore, this bug could be leveraged to allow updates of columns
      that an attacking user lacks <code class="literal">UPDATE</code> privilege for,
      if that user has <code class="literal">INSERT</code> and <code class="literal">UPDATE</code>
      privileges for some other column(s) of the table.
      Any user could also use it for disclosure of server memory.
      (CVE-2018-10925)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that updates to the <code class="structfield">relfrozenxid</code>
      and <code class="structfield">relminmxid</code> values
      for <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">nailed</span>”</span> system catalogs are processed in a timely
      fashion (Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      Overoptimistic caching rules could prevent these updates from being
      seen by other sessions, leading to spurious errors and/or data
      corruption.  The problem was significantly worse for shared catalogs,
      such as <code class="structname">pg_authid</code>, because the stale cache
      data could persist into new sessions as well as existing ones.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix case where a freshly-promoted standby crashes before having
      completed its first post-recovery checkpoint (Michael Paquier, Kyotaro
      Horiguchi, Pavan Deolasee, Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      This led to a situation where the server did not think it had reached
      a consistent database state during subsequent WAL replay, preventing
      restart.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid emitting a bogus WAL record when recycling an all-zero btree
      page (Amit Kapila)
     </p><p>      This mistake has been seen to cause assertion failures, and
      potentially it could result in unnecessary query cancellations on hot
      standby servers.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      During WAL replay, guard against corrupted record lengths exceeding
      1GB (Michael Paquier)
     </p><p>      Treat such a case as corrupt data.  Previously, the code would try to
      allocate space and get a hard error, making recovery impossible.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      When ending recovery, delay writing the timeline history file as long
      as possible (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>      This avoids some situations where a failure during recovery cleanup
      (such as a problem with a two-phase state file) led to inconsistent
      timeline state on-disk.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve performance of WAL replay for transactions that drop many
      relations (Fujii Masao)
     </p><p>      This change reduces the number of times that shared buffers are
      scanned, so that it is of most benefit when that setting is large.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve performance of lock releasing in standby server WAL replay
      (Thomas Munro)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Make logical WAL senders report streaming state correctly (Simon
      Riggs, Sawada Masahiko)
     </p><p>      The code previously mis-detected whether or not it had caught up with
      the upstream server.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that a snapshot is provided when executing data type input
      functions in logical replication subscribers (Minh-Quan Tran,
      Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      This omission led to failures in some cases, such as domains with
      constraints using SQL-language functions.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix bugs in snapshot handling during logical decoding, allowing wrong
      decoding results in rare cases (Arseny Sher, Álvaro Herrera)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Add subtransaction handling in logical-replication table
      synchronization workers (Amit Khandekar, Robert Haas)
     </p><p>      Previously, table synchronization could misbehave if any
      subtransactions were aborted after modifying a table being
      synchronized.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure a table's cached index list is correctly rebuilt after an index
      creation fails partway through (Peter Geoghegan)
     </p><p>      Previously, the failed index's OID could remain in the list, causing
      problems later in the same session.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix mishandling of empty uncompressed posting list pages in GIN
      indexes (Sivasubramanian Ramasubramanian, Alexander Korotkov)
     </p><p>      This could result in an assertion failure after pg_upgrade of a
      pre-9.4 GIN index (9.4 and later will not create such pages).
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Pad arrays of unnamed POSIX semaphores to reduce cache line sharing
      (Thomas Munro)
     </p><p>      This reduces contention on many-CPU systems, fixing a performance
      regression (compared to previous releases) on Linux and FreeBSD.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that a process doing a parallel index scan will respond to
      signals (Amit Kapila)
     </p><p>      Previously, parallel workers could get stuck waiting for a lock on an
      index page, and not notice requests to abort the query.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that <code class="command">VACUUM</code> will respond to signals
      within btree page deletion loops (Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      Corrupted btree indexes could result in an infinite loop here, and
      that previously wasn't interruptible without forcing a crash.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix hash-join costing mistake introduced with inner_unique
      optimization (David Rowley)
     </p><p>      This could lead to bad plan choices in situations where that
      optimization was applicable.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix misoptimization of equivalence classes involving composite-type
      columns (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This resulted in failure to recognize that an index on a composite
      column could provide the sort order needed for a mergejoin on that
      column.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix planner to avoid <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">ORDER/GROUP BY expression not found in
      targetlist</span>”</span> errors in some queries with set-returning functions
      (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix handling of partition keys whose data type uses a polymorphic
      btree operator class, such as arrays (Amit Langote, Álvaro
      Herrera)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix SQL-standard <code class="literal">FETCH FIRST</code> syntax to allow
      parameters (<code class="literal">$<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em></code>), as the
      standard expects (Andrew Gierth)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Remove undocumented restriction against duplicate partition key
      columns (Yugo Nagata)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Disallow temporary tables from being partitions of non-temporary
      tables (Amit Langote, Michael Paquier)
     </p><p>      While previously allowed, this case didn't work reliably.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="command">EXPLAIN</code>'s accounting for resource usage,
      particularly buffer accesses, in parallel workers
      (Amit Kapila, Robert Haas)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="command">SHOW ALL</code> to show all settings to roles that are
      members of <code class="literal">pg_read_all_settings</code>, and also allow
      such roles to see source filename and line number in
      the <code class="structname">pg_settings</code> view (Laurenz Albe,
      Álvaro Herrera)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix failure to schema-qualify some object names
      in <code class="function">getObjectDescription</code>
      and <code class="function">getObjectIdentity</code> output
      (Kyotaro Horiguchi, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Names of collations, conversions, text search objects, publication
      relations, and extended statistics objects were not schema-qualified
      when they should be.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="command">CREATE AGGREGATE</code> type checking so that
      parallelism support functions can be attached to variadic aggregates
      (Alexey Bashtanov)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Widen <code class="command">COPY FROM</code>'s current-line-number counter
      from 32 to 64 bits (David Rowley)
     </p><p>      This avoids two problems with input exceeding 4G lines: <code class="literal">COPY
      FROM WITH HEADER</code> would drop a line every 4G lines, not only
      the first line, and error reports could show a wrong line number.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Allow replication slots to be dropped in single-user mode
      (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      This use-case was accidentally broken in release 10.0.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect results from <code class="function">variance(int4)</code> and
      related aggregates when run in parallel aggregation mode
      (David Rowley)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Process <code class="literal">TEXT</code> and <code class="literal">CDATA</code> nodes
      correctly in <code class="function">xmltable()</code> column expressions
      (Markus Winand)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Cope with possible failure of <span class="application">OpenSSL</span>'s
      <code class="function">RAND_bytes()</code> function
      (Dean Rasheed, Michael Paquier)
     </p><p>      Under rare circumstances, this oversight could result in <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">could
      not generate random cancel key</span>”</span> failures that could only be
      resolved by restarting the postmaster.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">libpq</span>'s handling of some cases
      where <code class="literal">hostaddr</code> is specified
      (Hari Babu, Tom Lane, Robert Haas)
     </p><p>      <code class="function">PQhost()</code> gave misleading or incorrect results
      in some cases.  Now, it uniformly returns the host name if specified,
      or the host address if only that is specified, or the default host
      name (typically <code class="literal">/tmp</code>
      or <code class="literal">localhost</code>) if both parameters are omitted.
     </p><p>      Also, the wrong value might be compared to the server name when
      verifying an SSL certificate.
     </p><p>      Also, the wrong value might be compared to the host name field in
      <code class="filename">~/.pgpass</code>.  Now, that field is compared to the
      host name if specified, or the host address if only that is specified,
      or <code class="literal">localhost</code> if both parameters are omitted.
     </p><p>      Also, an incorrect error message was reported for an unparseable
      <code class="literal">hostaddr</code> value.
     </p><p>      Also, when the <code class="literal">host</code>, <code class="literal">hostaddr</code>,
      or <code class="literal">port</code> parameters contain comma-separated
      lists, <span class="application">libpq</span> is now more careful to treat
      empty elements of a list as selecting the default behavior.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Add a string freeing function
      to <span class="application">ecpg</span>'s <code class="filename">pgtypes</code>
      library, so that cross-module memory management problems can be
      avoided on Windows (Takayuki Tsunakawa)
     </p><p>      On Windows, crashes can ensue if the <code class="function">free</code> call
      for a given chunk of memory is not made from the same DLL
      that <code class="function">malloc</code>'ed the memory.
      The <code class="filename">pgtypes</code> library sometimes returns strings
      that it expects the caller to free, making it impossible to follow
      this rule.  Add a <code class="function">PGTYPESchar_free()</code> function
      that just wraps <code class="function">free</code>, allowing applications
      to follow this rule.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">ecpg</span>'s support for <code class="type">long

      change causes a change in the semantics of a statement intra-session
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This error led to assertion failures, or in rare cases, failure to
      enforce the <code class="literal">INTO STRICT</code> option as expected.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix password prompting in client programs so that echo is properly
      disabled on Windows when <code class="literal">stdin</code> is not the
      terminal (Matthew Stickney)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Further fix mis-quoting of values for list-valued GUC variables in
      dumps (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The previous fix for quoting of <code class="varname">search_path</code> and
      other list-valued variables in <span class="application">pg_dump</span>
      output turned out to misbehave for empty-string list elements, and it
      risked truncation of long file paths.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">pg_dump</span>'s failure to
      dump <code class="literal">REPLICA IDENTITY</code> properties for constraint
      indexes (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Manually created unique indexes were properly marked, but not those
      created by declaring <code class="literal">UNIQUE</code> or <code class="literal">PRIMARY

     </p><p>      The previous check could be fooled by an immediate-mode shutdown.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="filename">contrib/hstore_plperl</code> to look through Perl

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Rearrange makefiles to ensure that programs link to freshly-built

      in Ireland, as well as for some past years in Namibia and
      Czechoslovakia.  In those jurisdictions, legally standard time is
      observed in summer, and daylight savings time in winter, so that the
      daylight savings offset is one hour behind standard time not one hour
      ahead.  This does not affect either the actual UTC offset or the
      timezone abbreviations in use; the only known effect is that
      the <code class="structfield">is_dst</code> column in
      the <code class="structname">pg_timezone_names</code> view will now be true
      in winter and false in summer in these cases.
